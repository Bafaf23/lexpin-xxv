/**
 * Even more exercises
 * 
 * 1. Declare two variables, a = 10 and b = 3.
 * Calculate the remainder when a is divided by b and store it
 * in a variable called remainder.
 * 
 * 2. Declare a variable age = 25.
 * Write an expression using a comparison operator to check if age
 * is greater than or equal to 18. Store the result in a variable calle
 * isAdult.
 * 
 * 3. Declare a boolean variable isRaining = false.
 * Use the logical NOT operator (!) to reverse its value and store
 * the result in shouldStayInside.
 * 
 * 4. Declare a variable counter = 5. Use the post-increment operator (++)
 * once. What is the value of counter after the operation?
 * 
 * 5. A configuration setting is valid if its status is a boolean OR its level
 * is a number greater than 50. Declare status = null and level = 75. Write a
 * single expression to check the validity and store the boolean result in
 * isValidConfig
 * 
 * 6. Calculate the result of the expression: (5 * 4) + (20 / 5) - 3
 * WITHOUT executing the script.
 * 
 * 7. Declare numString = "5" and numInt = 5. Compare them first using the
 * loose equality operator (==) and then using the strict equality operator
 * (===). Store the results in looseResult and strictResult.
 * 
 * 8. Determine the final value of x after the following operations:
 * let x = 10;
 * x = x * 2 + 5 % 3;
 * WITHOUT executing the script.
 * 
 * 10. Determine if an integer year = 2024 is a leap year using only operators.
 * Other forms of code are not allowed. :)
